This is a fork of the Bela pattern library made by Astrid, that we'll be reusing as a foundation for the Inter/section style guide.

## To do

- [ ] Clean up the repository from Bela references, and adapt the [original README](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/bela_sample)
- [ ] Remove patterns that will not be needed
- [ ] Adapt the **currently existing** Inter/sections patterns into the library (and discuss them more specifically, if they need to be changed)
- [ ] Create patterns that haven't been developed yet to “fill” the rest of the library, again in consultation with the team
- [ ] Create a reference page specifically for printed artworks and artefacts (e.g. margins, colours in a standardised format)
- [ ] Consider if other new types of patterns or notes need to be created (for instance background images, what the good casing of “Inter/sections” is, where to find specific resources and where are artworks stored, etc.)
